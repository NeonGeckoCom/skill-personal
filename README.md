## Summary

Skill used for introduction between the user and Neon.

## Requirements

No special required packages for this skill.

## Description

Personal skill is responsible for introductions and information-acquiring communications between Neon and the user. Neon will use it to introduce himself, explain what and who he is, where he was born, and when it happened. In addition, it will obtain the userâ€™s full, partial, or just a first name, along with the email address, in order to use it for coupons and transcriptions.

## Examples

Ask Neon any question you would like to learn the answer to, such as `where were you born`, `who are you`, `when were you born`. Neon will prompt you to learn more information about you in return, so he can address you by your first name later down the road. Alternatively, you can introduce yourself by saying `Neon my name is` and waiting for a reply.
- who are you
- who made you
- my name is...
- my email address is...
- my klat username is...
- my password is...
